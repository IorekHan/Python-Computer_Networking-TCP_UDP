# Computer Network
  
This is a set of programming project in CU CSEE-4119(F2021) Computer Network.

The python files:  
    --segments.py  
    --sender.py  
    --receiver.py
are building a TCP connection with loss recovery mechanism. The TCP connection is built based on a UDP connection, the UDP conneciton system has settings about loss rate and related selections. The UDP simulator is provided by the course and professor. The markdown file:  
    TCP over UDP.md  
is the introduction about the system and codes in the terminal.

The python files:  
    --TCP Client.py   
    --TCP Sercer.py  
    --UDP Client.py  
    --UDP Server.py  
are building client and server using TCP/UDP protocal with python code.

The following are introductions about UDP clients and servers code:
